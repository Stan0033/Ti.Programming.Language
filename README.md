# Ti.Programming.Language

Ti (or also Tipl as in Ti programming language or Tilang) is a flexible, powerful, rich, natural, clean and easy to read and write beginner-friendly programming language currently in development . It is influenced by many programming languages as well as influenced by natural language grammar and original ideas for approaches to code.

Paradigm:
Semi-Interpreted, General-purpose, multi-paradigm, object-oriented(class-based and prototype-based), structured, Modular, Procedural, Event-Driven, Task-Driven, Functional, Array, Imperative, Declarative(for logic expressions), Pipeline, Railway, distributed, constraint, Case-Sensitive, Generic, Reflective, Concurrent, Meta, Parallel, Text-Oriented, Logic, Symbolic, Dataflow, Contract, Parallel(process-oriented), Natural.

Typing Discipline:
Static and dynamic(through variants and type annotations), nominative and structural, manifest and inferred(optional), weak and strong(optional), parametric, flow-sensitive, typed, untyped(optional), unsafe, safe (optional), duck(optional).
